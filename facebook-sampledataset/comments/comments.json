I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been welfare secretary for 2 months, and all I wanted to say is that the idea being spread that everyone in the club is the same awful person is wrong, and make public that every uninvolved member supports victims coming forwards. Over the next year I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be trying even harder to improve the culture of the club.\n\nAyotomi IF , nobody can \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontrol\u00e2\u0080\u009d other people, or \u00e2\u0080\u009ckeep them in line\u00e2\u0080\u009d, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not possible - and we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even punish them if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who has done what (club wide allegations have this problem). I want the concerns taken seriously, which was why I suggested the venue through which this can be done.\n\nI take on board your criticisms of my response, but ultimately without formal allegations, we know nothing about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened - as anyone who does something wrong is definitely not going to say - and a lot of people who are not guilty are told they are scum (while being powerless to stop the behaviour as they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who did what).",

The individuals responsible should be held accountable, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think their mistakes should affect the rest of the people in the club.\n\nI am not trying to silence victims, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to encourage them to make their voices heard somewhere that can make a difference.\n\nThe only way to weed them out is to report them to the union, because uninvolved members of our club don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about it until it gets reported. We all want this behaviour to stop - I agree that as a club we have more to do.",

I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t at this social when this happened last year, and I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say (nor do I believe) that no guys ever do bad things.\n\nWhat I said in my previous response to the UCLove allegations was that there are over 100 people in the club who are not a homogenous group, and that I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen the horrendous things mentioned in that  previous post - which remains the case. \n\nI also said that people should go to the union with complaints (instead of UCLove) so they can be properly dealt with.\n\nThe process that led to this is exactly what should happen when someone behaves like this, as it has identified and punished the correct individuals.\n\nI still actively encourage people to go to the union when they have a problem with anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions. I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that less than 6% of a group represent everyone in the group. For what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth, I apologise on behalf of people in the club who weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involved for not being there to stop what happened, and not successfully changing the culture fast enough.",

I can only speak for this year and last year, as freshers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access to senior chats, but in this time period, I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen behaviour as is described (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen rude behaviour - the phineas bus - but never dangerous behaviour). I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to reconfirm that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actively encouraging people to go forwards to the union if you have experienced unacceptable behaviour from a current club member, or feel free to get in touch with me.\n\nIn some ways it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a problem of university sports clubs, as the actions of previous club members affect the whole club\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation down the line. Our club has changed substantively in the past two years, even if the laddy attitude remains. Who would have guessed that last year we would have had an openly gay member of the starting Varsity XV, or be running a touch session jointly with women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for all abilities every Saturday (not a huge thing but wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have happened in previous years).\n\nI hope that by trying to explain our club has changed, I am not silencing or ignoring anyone. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that we should be judged by the actions of predecessors, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that we should be judged as a homogenous group on an anonymous online forum. If the sad day comes that a member is found having done something unacceptable, I, and the rest of the club, think they should be accused in the appropriate venue (the union), and not on Facebook.",

It's currently going up by 6% a year, which on a loan of \u00c2\u00a340,000 would be \u00c2\u00a32400 a year. A 9% extra \"tax\" if it isn't reallly a debt on all income above \u00c2\u00a325k is a huge amount to add onto other taxes for a whole generation of graduates.\n\nIf you add to this that the wealthier in society don't take the loans and their parents pay for it, it's actually almost a regressive policy because it hits those who are successful but who aren't from a wealthy enough background to not take the loan in the first place i.e. the middle.\n\nI support a smaller tuition fee of \u00c2\u00a33000, and think that there should be a mixed maintenance loan and grant system where anyone can access loans but grants are for lower income students. I don't really see how funding arrangements would require a dramatic restructuring of higher education in general, surely just funding systems?\n\nIn reality, it is a debt because if you earn a medium amount you'll be paying it back for 30 years. Also, there are so many examples of other countries with free education, being better than the USA on this is a non-achievement. We call it a debt because if it got called a graduate tax on middle earners it would have been shot down as it potentially should have been. The punitive interest rate is what realllly kills it as I said. I agree we should encourage working class people to go to university but I feel like what we call it is a smokescreen for worse problems in the system that would have a bigger effect if they were fixed.",

A 9% extra tax on all income above \u00c2\u00a325k is a huge policy change if that's what you are advocating for.\n\nThe other problem is that yes it does give more money to universities, but often you pay for more than the university is actually spending to teach you and the university goes and spends it on paying their administrative and executive staff spiralling salaries. \n\nAdd to this that the wealthier in society don't take the loans and their parents pay for it, it's actually a not quite a regressive or a progressive tax because it hits those who are successful but who aren't from a wealthy enough background to not take the loan in the first place i.e. the middle.\n\nIt's not ideal all in all. It's not awful either, but definitely doesn't do the job it's supposed to.",

I don't know enough about the views of other party members but labour should obviously kick out anyone anti Semitic/discriminatory. Fully back campaigns against it, but I haven't heard of many cases of treating anti Semitism lightly - livingstone kicked out, quite a few (but perhaps not enough) members kicked out. I think it's only a very small minority of dodgy people who hold those views, which has perhaps been exaggerated, but yeah, get rid of any anti-Jewish sentiment (not confusing criticism of Israel with criticism of Jews). Needs treating seriously, and seems to be happening if not quickly enough.",

So I am an atheist, in that I lack belief in religions/reckon religions are probably wrong.  But also an agnostic: I accept the logical truth that it is impossible to prove nonexistence, and that there may be some indifferent (I.e. abandoned us) higher power(s), and I have no way of knowing for certain.

Sexy oat biscuits? It promises to throw INto relief other facets of love, the austere, punishINg and holy. Relationships could crack under the pressure.

That would take you to 29% in the basic tax bracket and up to 49% on anything above \u00c2\u00a343,000. People would be fuuurious about that if you tried to impose that on people. That is an incredibly punitive tax rate to place on people going to university. If the fees were lower, say around \u00c2\u00a33,000 a year, and the repayments were 5% a year, then maybe that would be reasonable.\n\nAlso, until you start paying tax on earnings above about \u00c2\u00a338,000, you are net taking from the state, and even after that, there is a lot of other things that I'd hope you'd not be so penny pinching on such as pensions + healthcare + normal education, so don't start worrying about your tax bill going on educating young people until you earn serious money.",

            "comment": "You are right, and I guess the idea is not to disregard the current struggle, but to show some grounds for hope that through long hard struggle we can actually improve the world. Knowing that what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to do has made a difference should inspire us to try and do more things. The news doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report positive general trends because they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good commercial copy, so there can sometimes be this feeling that the world is getting worse, because there are more scandals and natural disasters that we know about. And, iff that was the case that would be a depressing reality because it would mean all the people trying and hoping for it to be better aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t succeeding at all. These \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood news statistics\u00e2\u0080\u009d try to counter that narrative, so we can approach current problems in the knowledge that even though our attempts won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make things perfect, hopefully they will make things better. Change will still be tough, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a long way to go.",

But I don't think that that is a real problem to be solved, it is clearly impossible. More interesting is the problem of satisfying wants that are unlimited in terms of variety, and higher quality. This is solveable, and while unlimited living standards (what wants translate into when satisfied, demerit goods aside) clearly can't be achieved, we can achieve better living standards, and that should be the goal of all modern economics. What would providing everyone with free basic foods do that would be bad? As long as you made sure that you incentivised producers enough, avoiding the supply problem that affects economies without enough incentives (state socialist ones we've seen), it would be fine.",

Frederick I think that atheism/theism is just about whether or not one holds a belief, and agnosticism is about whether or not one claims that it is a justified true belief (gnostic atheist/theist) or whether they don't know (agnostic atheist/theist). Gnostics claim knowledge (that their belief is justified true), agnostics do not. Works perfectly as the distinction. Atheists lack a belief in god, but some claim that their lack of belief is the truth, the gnostic atheists. (They claim to have a justified true belief about their lack of belief). Those who don't claim justified true belief about their lack of belief, are agnostic atheists.",

But we do have a prostate for some reason that provides pleasure when stimulated, wonder what the biological function of a pleasure organ stimulated by anal sex is.\n\nBiology is confusing, and homosexuality works within that system. I think declaiming biological purposes (or nature's intended purpose - nature does not have intentions) of organs simplifies a complex system of multipurpose organs, so doesn't really work as a paradigm through which to judge things.",

            "comment": "Finance wise, joining the military entitles you to free healthcare if I'm not wrong, comprehensive health insurance. So the costs of transitioning aren't an argument. Time off work? Like any non-physical health issue, time off work is standard, and encouraged in fact, in order to help you be able to resolve it. No problem there: even if they have more time off than the average military personnel, they are still doing military work most of the time. Culture within the military? Well much like it needed to change about gay people and women being in the military, why would this be any different, it should be able to tolerate, or better, accept trans people too. Having trans people working in it shouldn't make the \"culture\" less effective any more than having women and gay people would.\n\nthe argument that the military is there to protect the country first and foremost and no studies so far suggest that allowing transgender people into it increase its ability to do that, unlike women where studies suggest it does................ Yeah, let the military protect the country, and let people who want to contribute join the military. Unless you can show me unequivocal proof that having a trans person working for the military makes the absolute effectiveness of the military lower (not average, absolute), then there is no reason why they should not have the freedom to do so. It's the same story as it was for allowing racism in the military, homophobia in the military and sexism in the military. Totally baseless reactionary crap, justified by baseless reactionary crap.",

True freedom is decommodification of citizens. It's just a shame that some people think freedom is low taxes and big guns.",

            "comment": "Railway nationalisation works across the globe, water I'm not concerned about who runs it (if states can run trains they can run water).\n\nPost office got sold at a discount, and was a publicly run competitor that helped provide downward pressure on private firms prices.\n\nHe proposed pay ratios for firms winning public contracts to ensure taxpayers money doesn't get skimmed into a CEOs pay packet - responsible allocation of taxpayers money. The Labour Party wouldn't roll that out anywhere else, because that justification doesn't work anywhere else, and companies that don't take public money are under no obligation to the taxpayer.\n\nI do know the difference between zero hour be temporary, it's the article you shared that chose to falsely equate them. They aren't banning zero hours contracts, simply mandating that workers have the option of being guaranteed how much they will work each week in order to be able to plan their lives. Roadies could have temporary contracts rather than zero hours contracts, was my point, so that writer's claim that roadies would have to be paid outside tour dates is bullshit.\n\nI think that \u00c2\u00a310 for 16 year olds is excessive yes, but equal pay for equal work should definitely be a thing. If it could be shown that 16 year olds are just as productive then fair enough but I kind of doubt that that's the case.\n\nDiscussing the track records of nationalised industries competing with a newly globalised economy where coal miners and steel workers now have to compete with desperate dirt poor workers being exploited in unregulated countries to undercut western workers is a very complex issue that can't be boiled down to \"nationalisation bad\". Plenty of private companies failed for the same reasons. Railway usage after a prolonged period of serious economic strife is going to be lower.\n\nI don't support nationalisation as a point of principle, only where there is proof (models in other countries) that a particular natural monopoly can operate better in public hands or in priv\u00c3\u00a2t hands, or where there is evidence that higher consumption of that good will be beneficial for the whole of the economy, like healthcare and education. I think Royal Mail fits the second category, and that railways fit the first one, and water I don't know anything about.",

In 1971 the top rate of income tax on earned income was cut to 75% from 90%. A surcharge of 15% kept the top rate on investment income at 90%. In 1974 the cut was partly reversed and the top rate on earned income was raised to 83%. With the investment income surcharge this raised the top rate on investment income to 98%, the highest permanent rate since the war. This applied to incomes over \u00c2\u00a320,000 (\u00c2\u00a3187,970 as of 2015),[7]. In 1974 750,000 people were liable to pay the top-rate of income tax. - Wikipedia, History of taxation in the UK\n\nLabour's tax rises wouldn't make anyone move anywhere, and equating them to the 1970s is utterly ridiculous.\nMinimum wages - if Glasto is sooo bourgeouis, then the food would still be affordable even if you have to pay caterers \u00c2\u00a310 an hour, and the festival is plenty profitable to pay security \u00c2\u00a310 an hour - look at the founder's support for Corbyn.\nContract changes - totally intentional misunderstanding of what banning a zero hours contract would mean. Temporary contracts still perfectly possible, for the length of tour or whatever, he has made that up.\nPay ratios for bands? This writer is a joke, \"a corbyn government would presumably.....\" sure presume whatever total fantasy you like.\nAnd of course, let's imagine Corbyn will cap prices for everything including festival tickets, and nationalise everything too, because that is a fair representation of a social democratic manifesto that embraces the best parts of capitalism while trying to not leave the impoverished behind.\n\nWooo, yeah, let's cite a spectator blog by some funny(straw)man as if it holds any water, because people might just see the article and assume that its sensationalist headline has any truth to it whatsoever.\n\nApologies for the tone of some of what I've written if it's a bit unfair.",

Talks about 2010. Investing in education, housing, infrastructure and health is to my mind the best way any government can prime an economy for growth. In this way the government creates HUUge economic value by massively increasing the productivity of its labour force. To call it an orgy of public spending is to massively misrepresent it.\n\nInterest on student debt makes it unaffordable, and makes it an effective  9% increase in income tax in the bracket of \u00c2\u00a321,000 and above, which in any other context would be scandalous, but because it is a \"loan\" rather than a graduate income tax, is apparently fine. Hugely regressive tax on all those whose parents can't pay their fees outright, and on those students who are likely to earn middle incomes (21-50k) throughout their lives, who will have to pay 9% of that bracket for 30 years.",

I think it's fair to let the governing party know that you don't support their leader through protest. I'd just like to compare protest to the media. If the media called on May to resign, or called on other journalists to provide political pressure to get the leader out, would that be as outrageous? Would you, if a Telegraph journalist had called for May's resignation, be just as outraged?\n\nMcDonnell is questionable, I agree, but in terms of policy outcomes from their victory, I can only see Labour as being good for the country. People actually protested against Trump, not just his policies, just for the record, and all of the protests have been aimed at expressing discontent at his presidency.\n\nI think it is fair to protest/rally for absolutely anything as long as it is non violent and you can get people involved. It is a valid way of expressing your political opinion, and even if you think that the reason they are protesting for is dumb, wrong, distasteful, they still have a right to protest. And feel free to go and form an anti-protest against them - see the EDL marches.",

I wonder how well informed that committee was about the renovations they were passing through, or the state of the block, I don't imagine they were able to go to the block itself, although perhaps they had some residents' complaints, I don't know. Everyone who has some responsibility for the critical lack of care taken to maintain the block needs to take a long hard look at themselves. I think that a large proportion of your political party voting against a bill that could have had a significant effect on some of the worse landlords across britain is certainly something that you should think about quite hard.\n\nIt seems like the independent review was not fit for purpose, and that the oversight committee was not fit for purpose, and in fact that deprived areas like these simply do not get adequate levels of attention from government at any level, and that needs to be addressed. I think it was Akala who said that this simply would never have happened to a rich, luxury tower of flats, because they aren't forced by their economic situation to stay in poor unsafe conditions and because they would find it far easier to make the council listen. The cladding was put on in order to make the tower less of an eyesore.\n\nPublic enquiries often mean absolutely fuck all. They are more often an obfuscation of the situation that leads to no actionable findings and a 10,000 page report, in which nobody gets blamed and nothing gets done. It seems unlikely that this enquiry will be any different, and I would imagine that any of the landlords in this country that are indeed \"pesky\" will see no change in the way they have to operate at all as a result of it.",

Boris Johnson when pressed about cuts to the fire service boorishly dismissed another MPs concerns as \"guff\" or something like that, and passing that law would have sent a message to landlords and given councils more power to make things happen. Cuts to council funding surely play a part in this as it makes them unable to adequately carry out their duties (and a lot of Conservative austerity was just pushed to councils, passing the buck). \n\nI don't see how passing legislation to make homes fit for human habitation can reasonably be called \"unnecessary legislation\" when you end up with an tower block where neither the sprinklers nor the fire alarms work and the refurbishment that was done put in cosmetic cladding that wasn't fire retardant (in fact seemed to burn very easily). It is not low to show a clear link between your parties policies and the causes of a tragedy, when your party voted to put less pressure on landlords to make their properties safe and secure. Who are the people really at risk here? I really don't think that it's the landlords at risk of \"unnecessary regulation\" who we should be worrying about, and yet that is exactly what the Conservative party has done year upon year, government upon government.",

            "comment": "I don't support all the positions of the Labour leaders themselves, rather I strongly support the manifesto and I strongly support about 80% of Corbyn's views. As far as I'm concerned, any non violent protest is \"innocent\", in that it only functions as a form of political pressure no more powerful (mostly significantly less powerful) than political pressure from the media and political pressure from powerful wealthy people. Protest in itself simply cannot oust a democratically elected leader, but it is totally within its rights to express their dissatisfaction with that leader and their wish for that leader to go, much like the protests against Trump - or do you condemn them just as strongly?\n\nIf protest could force a government to go, then I would agree with you. Given that it can't, and it is simply a way for large groups of people to apply political pressure, I think it's fine.\n\nIt's worth remembering we don't have democratically elected leaders, we actually have democratically elected parties who elect their leaders, and so I would argue it is fair to protest against their selection/continued support of that leader.\n\nThe DUP is very far right on social matters, it is at heart a theocratic party that is homophobic, anti women's (reproductive) rights, and denies climate change. While it certainly isn't the most far right party in Europe, there aren't many more far right parties than the DUP in Western Europe and I'd say it's top 10 in the right wing rankings out of any parties with some significance.\n\nThe liberal right protest through the media and through their economically magnified political voice. For them (forgive my stereotyping here, I think it is roughly fair however), going out on the streets is a waste of money. Street protest is not their most effective way of getting their voice heard so it makes sense that they wouldn't do that.",

            "comment": "The liberal right by and large demographically don't have much to protest about. There isn't all that much arm twisting and shadow boxing nowadays is there? Haven't seen much of it? Unless you mean doctors protesting about the stretching of the NHS or (more arguably selfish) rail strikes (although they still had a point of sorts).\n\nI am at least as annoyed as you at those members of the left who see politics as a shouting match. It frustrates me a lot to see it happen. But without making any noise and showing any dissent, you can be very sure that nothing will change. Protest allows for political expression outside of the party political system in this country, which I think is very important.\n\nObviously I disagree with McDonnell if he said that, I would like a link to that interview just to know better what he is like.\n\nUnions have some power but I would say you are exaggerating their influence for your own reasons. They really aren't that big a deal most of the time, they are just helpful for workers to organise in order to redress the huge imbalance of power normally found between employers and employees, and for that I think they are both useful and important.\n\nThe London riots originally began as a protest against the killing or internment (I don't remember which) of a man that his community believed was innocent. I can see why that would be condoned. Obviously they spread way out of control and became selfish pursuits of personal gain during a time of chaos, which is deplorable. But the original reasoning behind why they occurred was fair enough.\n\nWhy do you think that it is unacceptable to protest against a democratically elected leader? Especially given their abandonment of principle to form a coalition with one of the most far right parties in Europe? I think it's fine to protest trump, and it is fine to protest may. To be honest, protest what you like if enough people care about it enough.",

Venezuela is an awful situation that has come about partially because of a terribly managed state socialist system, which I think is a very bad way to run a country (however it is a straw man to compare labour's plans to what has happened in Venezuela). I want capitalism to be how economies function, but for the government's role to be providing more merit goods and investing in the future economy, and giving people good educations regardless of their background.\n\nI'm sure it's easier to confuse the system that led to Venezuela's total failure with the moderate proposal for more taxation that Labour have proposed than it is to actually argue against investing in a sustainable economy by educating our people and making sure that the essential bases of a healthy economy are there (education, health, housing and infrastructure), but Venezuela isn't even close to what Labour are campaigning for.

No I am suggesting that for wealthy people they can use their wealth for political influence whereas protest is democratic in that anyone can do it. It is the primary source of non-voting power for those who can't donate. I was not saying that only the impoverished protest.\n\nI think protesting the coalition with the DUP is hugely legitimate. As is any source of dissatisfaction with the current government. I don't quite see how unions are so painfully undemocratic? People pay out of choice, and get to vote on stuff, and they donate while knowing that their donations are going to be political.",

It is in some sense a donation to a political cause, and allows those who don't have huge amounts of money to donate (Conservative party donors) with their time and voice to a cause they believe in. It is the only way in which those without wealth can make their voice heard. If \"respecting the result of a democratic election\" means shutting up while the conservatives form an alliance with the DUP and pursue a hard brexit, then I think that that would be a travesty. Accepting the result doesn't mean minorities staying silent, it means not going and violently changing it. A protest against an outcome that is democratic is an entirely valid method of political expression.\n\nNobody is saying that those people with placards should make all the decision, but they are allowed to speak up on what they want. Because democracy isn't just about voting once every five (or two \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008f) years.\n\nProtest isn't dangerous, claiming that protest is dangerous is dangerous.",

Jeremy's weakness was this circular argument of people thinking he was unelectable and then not supporting him, reinforcing this unelectability.\n\nThe reason why they didn't win the election is because of the lack of belief among the PLP, the media, and therefore the labour campaigners, that they could win. We won nearly every seat we targeted, just that because of the horrendous predictions we didn't end up targeting anywhere near enough seats.\n\nThis is the main reason why they didn't win. Your claim that there is no reason they shouldn't win is again totally misregarding context. From a position where he didn't have the backing of his party and where the media attacked him day after day after day, he managed to get 40% of the vote. If the PLP had backed him, and polling numbers didn't threaten huge losses, we would have campaigned in Amber Rudd's seat, and tens or other seats, and could have potentially won them.\n\nLabour were fighting a defensive campaign trying to achieve damage limitation. They ended up increasing vote share by more than any other election since Atlee, taking votes from every single other party. If you think that there is no such thing as momentum in politics then look at Corbyn's and May's post election appearances on Andrew Marr, look at their body language.\n\nThe conservatives in a minority government was more than any labour supporter could hope for a month ago. It's the defiance of expectations which is the key thing. You can't win if you don't target enough seats to win because you are fighting defensively because of poll numbers and lack of support from loud voices.\n\nThe hard and short of the matter is that \"in power\" is a very strong term for not having a majority and facing a huge struggle to pass any legislation. I think you are wrong about who will end up helping in brexit negotiations. Please keep ignoring context and claiming that nothing can be learned from defying the huge power of the media and New Labour to get 40% of the vote (that would have won the last 3 elections). If the rest of the conservatives believe they have won, then I'm happy. Polling numbers now suggest labour are above conservatives. Look at the change in support. Hugely meaningful. Anyway, let's wait until the next election, shouldn't be long!",

Consider it in terms of what \"lines\" each party used to use and how damaged their credibility is now, and what their future potential is. Conservatives no longer can use strength, stability, or competence as a political argument, which has always been their main line. Corbyn is now quite obviously electable (40% of the vote is a hugely electable amount) and post election polling shows labour having overtaken conservatives. Conservatives are dropping their principles like flies to stay in power, and look awfully placed for the next election, while Labour hasn't seen such an energised base or such passion or such good ground game for decades, if not forever. You are kidding yourself if you think that this election shows electoral faith in the tories.\n\nCorbyn may not have gotten a degree but he has been learning all his life, which is more important that going for some degree that doesn't teach you that much.\n\nLabour suddenly look best placed for the next election. The Tories have been forced to try to get into bed with the DUP (which looks awful), and it's looking like this election might lead to a soft brexit - which is the most important outcome possible from this election. That is a successful campaign for labour, especially in Context, especially when seeing how much polling numbers changed, especially seeing how many doubters have been proven wrong. It's twee to dismiss it as \"oh you still lost\" because it means that you aren't taking into account the implications of this election for Brexit and for future elections.",

The NHS benefits both you and society, so you should both pay. If you choose to go to uni, why should the taxpayer foot the bill; if you choose to go to the doctor why should the taxpayer foot the bill.\n\nRoads and their maintenance benefit both you and society so you should both pay. If you choose to go to uni, why should the taxpayer foot the bill; if you choose to drive on the roads why should the taxpayer foot the bill.\n\nGo to the police, need the fire brigade, etc.\n\nThe main idea of a collectivised government, with a welfare state and public services to help society and the economy function, is to collectivise costs in order to best benefit society. I'd be ok with 3k a year, but 9k is just unreasonable. Free education would in effect give everyone's kids the chance to go to uni, which I think can only be a good thing - especially when combined with a funded school system that can compete with the world.",

I can't understand why the preferred interview tactic there was to quiz and not to discuss whether the policy is worth the money and why Labour believe it will be a positive change. After all, that's what is important",

I don't see how anyone can be expected to know every costing for an ambitious, wide ranging manifesto, nor do I understand in what sense a photographic memory makes one more qualified for the role. Memorising figures isn't part of the general job description, he's not on university challenge. Interviewers should surely discuss and challenge rather than spot-quiz.",

In general on nukes, it's like having a massive sledgehammer, when everything you are trying to do is actually represented by small nails and pins. We have a military that is able to act with huge precision and overwhelming force without nukes, it would be a rare situation where nukes are a better option in terms of military effect than anything else. In terms of as a deterrent, you have to press it if they press it (unless you can stop/disarm the nuke, which I would have thought you could but idk). I'm voting labour despite some clear issues and despite some things I disagree with. The future of our economy here is more important, and right now what it needs is investment spending, both in capital and (most importantly) in education. The IRA, Diane Abbott, nukes, in terms of how I want the country governed, I think they just aren't as key issues as fiscal policy and government investment. \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008a\u00f0\u009f\u008d\u0080",

I reckon our democratic institutions and the way we approach politics has to be fundamentally changed. I'd be interested in there being a government system where you could register your preferences on an issue, so people can choose more specifically what they want. Make politics more about policy than politicians. Would make \"election management\" more difficult, and hopefully the public more engaged. I don't know what a perfect solution would look like, I just know there is a big issue of money in politics, and that it's easier than ever to contribute behind the scenes.",

You have taken advantage of those who are naive and desperate enough to seek hope where there was only theft.\n\nSomeone might do something voluntarily (like take heroin) but you are still exploiting them by selling them it. You are not providing a real solution to the problem. The guy who founded MMM is just the dealer of a 21st century drug, and is a morally corrupt individual. Either you know how MMM works and are the same as the founder, or you don't and you're fortunate and naive in equal measure. Either one makes you a person who is hard to hold in high esteem.",

The Straw Man argument is one which sets up a low-quality/false version of the opposition argument to knock it down easily, as we see here.\n\nImmigration policy today is about making sure the ageing population being a tax burden is balanced out by people of working age paying tax, it's about filling the gaps in our workforce with people who can do those jobs (see NHS, catering). I'll admit that part of the reason why people think immigrants are stealing jobs is because the adult training/apprenticeship programs in the UK and the US have been neglected and run down for so many years, but that's not the fault of immigrants.\n\nTL:DR - we don't take in immigrants out of some altruistic attempt to solve world poverty. We do it for the needs of our own economy.",

Capital punishment is more barbaric than no capital punishment, and within capital punishment, the guillotine is less barbaric than burning or the electric chair.",

In general, it requires truly appalling cycling skills to threaten serious or fatal injury to others. Skipping red lights is annoying but they're the ones risking their own skin there, it's on them if they cycle into traffic. Cyclists cause minimal wear on roads, and minimal environmental damage. Roads aren't just for cars, and the difficulty of a test should be based on the danger you may pose to others.",

Back up your claims that there are more than enough economic opportunities (when the under-employment level - where people are significantly overqualified for their jobs e.g. A law school graduate working in a Starbucks because there aren't any lawyer jobs for them - is the highest it's ever been - hardly showing a wealth of opportunities).\n\nIf you make ridiculous claims (or any claims at all) BACK THEM UP.",

I don't know how I could ever judge the cause, and I would err always on the side of not doing it, but I do think that at some point you could justify it.

The global money system conveniently allowed the countries with power a far stronger exchange rate, to go and exploit poorer countries. I have often wondered what would happen if a country with enough agricultural land closed itself off to outside investment and had a brilliantly organised effort to become self sustaining. I think we put too much faith in globalisation's ability to help less developed nations. When England began the industrial revolution, it didn't have to worry about being exploited by richer countries, who forced it to grow coffee and make clothes that were not for that country.",

That's why when religion held the most power (The Dark Ages in England/Europe where nothing was invented or written), the least progress was made. When religion backs off from trying/being able to control all aspects of life (particularly discovery related ones), that is when societal and economic progress occurs. From my admittedly poor understanding of modern African religion, religion is still controlling large parts of people's lives.",

            "comment": "HIG ROZUFF  so it wouldn't just be a one size fits all policy, an owner occupied house or a first home would be tax exempt, for precisely that reason. And imagine the extra money one would get from the scrapping of income tax.\n\nIt really doesn't encourage cash in hand/splashing out unless you are unable to invest your money at above perhaps 3%. The tax wouldn't need to be higher than roughly 1%. Investing money at 3% (inflation+1% based on BofE target) would keep it's value (the inflation target is 2% obviously it varies but higher inflation means the economy is probably doing better). Investing at higher than inflation+1% would be the aim rather than just higher than inflation. It would be simple to have a wealth allowance as well, but the scrapping of income tax would probably mean that people wouldn't need it.\n\nIf rental prices go up, so does the incentive to get into renting (thus putting prices back down). The small payments to the government when renting your second/tenth home out would be covered by the rent, and if the rent wasn't high enough to cover the costs, the value of the house would go down until the correct equilibrium was reached.\n\nFeel free to invest your money anywhere you like, houses or other investments, and if you make more than a 1% real value gain on your investment annually, then you are doing fine.\n\nYou are correct that the current inheritance tax system does create problems. It should probably be cleared up, but it definitely shouldn't be scrapped. What's yours should be yours sounds nice. How about what was your great great great great grandfather's should be yours? How about we need to find money to spend on the things that the country needs most that aren't being provided by the private sector (investment in infrastructure, healthcare, education, community projects and welfare)? The reason why inheritance tax is good is because the people inheriting are doing fine before they inherit. It isn't taking money out of their bank account, rather it is just reducing the windfall they receive (makes it a less positive amount rather than a negative amount).\n\nI think taxing when you earn is stupid. It means that someone with billions of familial wealth earnings \u00c2\u00a360k gets taxed less than someone who is first generation out of university earning \u00c2\u00a380k. It's a travesty for social mobility and any attempt to redistribute wealth or have a nation that doesn't have rapidly, constantly increasing inequality (which correlates with a  lot of negative societal outcomes).\n\nI agree the state should be an essential background. Education, healthcare, infrastructure and wealth redistribution. Your money should be your own, but this is just a different way of deciding how much everyone contributes to the systems our country needs. The richer you are, the more you benefit from the country having a well educated and healthy populace who can commute easily (because you employ them or invest in companies that do). So because you benefit more, you should contribute more. Basing it on income makes far less sense.\n\nIt would still remain your choice what you did with your money. It wouldn't be unfair at all, and of course one would try and get rid of loopholes. You aren't paying the government to keep hold of your property, you are paying them for all of the systems that need to be in place for you to live, work, eat, get healthcare, education, travel, be safe.... because without money they couldn't exist. That is what you are paying for.",

A wealth tax (the premise this land tax is based on) would actually incentivise investment and saving, because what would happen is in order to maintain or increase wealth, you would need to invest money above the tax+inflation. People would try to make their money work harder, but it would also mean that everyone's after tax incomes would be significantly increased (as they are no longer taxed).\n\nReplacing the income tax with a wealth tax would be a huge step forward. It would increase social mobility more than almost any other change in history has, and it would allow for redistribution of wealth to occur as it is supposed to. I don't believe that my great great grandfather's accomplishments should mean that I am so wealthy I don't have to work, do you?\n\nI think that each generation should be able to pass on a large proportion of the gains from their work (60% as it currently stands), but that there should be a constant equalising pressure where money is taken proportionally to how much money people actually have, and put into services and education for the whole country to benefit from.",

There are some clearly immoral commandments in Mosaic law, the ones mentioned above being examples. What category is it OK for there to be an immoral commandment in back in those days. Why didn't God condemn slavery or rape? They surely cannot come under civil rules or worship rules.\n\n\"Love your neighbour as yourself\" wasn't invented by Christianity by any means. It is everywhere from ancient Babylon Chinese philosophy, and the same for all the non-religious Ten Commandments.\n\nThe OT is completely defined by its historical and cultural contexts, with absolutely nothing in it which suggests any divine hand guiding the writing of it, nothing that couldn't have been known at that time. No new moral revelations, no new information about the world, no new philosophical ideas. Same with the NT. A book with divine truth in it and a divine hand guiding it should either have been written to apply to all cultures, or be clear about what is supposed to expire upon the coming of the Messiah and what is not. Instead, it allows everyone their own interpretation, causing suffering and strife. Also it should have been clearer about when this messiah guy was gonna come, because obviously loads of Jews think Jesus wasn't the real messiah, which should have been really really clear, given he was \"god's son\".

It is easy to extrapolate our own experiences and think they must be shared, but perhaps it could be different. But I have no idea, we'll see hopefully!",

It is still a useful thing, but questions have to be asked. It is not as simple as you like to imagine the world to be. Obeying social norms can help make her safe, in certain circumstances, but it does not \"make her safe. FULL STOP.\" Not asking questions doesn't make you safe (unless you question kings/emperors/religion in medieval societies), and neither does following social norms. You should seek information about why the social norm is in place and then decide to follow it or not (of course in life or death or where there is not the opportunity follow the screaming crowd, but don't think you can then generalise that decision to all social norms in all situations).",

The miracles: plagiarised or incredibly unoriginal and they never happened. It's easy for a skilled performer to convince a gullible crowd of uneducated people of stuff. See Trump, Hitler, every magician ever.\n\nI never ever ever admitted he did miracles at any other place. I merely highlighted that he categorically didn't do them there and failed to convince those closest to him, who should have known with more certainty than anyone that he was divine if he actually was so. The fact that they reject his divinity or even status as a prophet is telling. I don't believe he did miracles anywhere (see convincing stupid people above).",

He was also unable to perform any miracles in his home town and everyone who knew him growing up thought he was a fraud. \n\nYou believe a different side of the story, but the point still stands.

There are plenty of alternative social media sites which do all sorts of quirky things (see naan breads/focaccia) but they just aren't as good as pizza. Which is why neither pizza nor Facebook is trying to become like focaccia or Pinterest.\n\nDo you think there is any truth to that? Or do you think that innovation should always proceed regardless of whether it actually makes things better. Or perhaps you think that things should always improve and that there is never any excuse for not doing so (see pizza).\n\nJust a few thoughts :)",

No agency means that the sense of self on which we blame most of our successes and failures is in fact not in our control at the level of physics, and as such credit for \"success\" or \"failure\" however humans may define them must go to our genetics, environment, and the Heisenberg (to put it simply, to the atoms and forces that make us up), rather than being in some way our own. (This is my current position on the situation)\n\nOn a societal level, we perhaps need to continue with our custom of blaming people for actions and rewarding them for their failures. These incentives are likely required for progress (if we think progress is a good in itself!). I think people may not like to think they have a lack of agency (people always create narratives explaining why they do what they do).",

The fact that there exist people who seem to have a good grasp of science and reason who are also religious is irrelevant to the meme.\n\nThe suspension of belief is an incredibly powerful thing. It isn't surprising that somebody could engage in \"doublethink\" (to steal from George Orwell) to hold two contradictory beliefs at the same time because both are too strongly ingrained in their psyche to ignore.\n\nMy worldview is categorically NOT based on the assertion or authority of these \"new atheist 'scientists'\" you seem so skeptical of. In fact it's based on a lot of thought and sound reasoning. The fact that people like Bertrand Russell, Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and couuuuntless other incredibly respected figures (who I would say hold a lot of authority) agree with me is not fundamental to my belief.\n\nReligious institutions have always been against science, because their power is based in \"knowing\" something that the people they preach to don't. Science attacks the God of the gaps, reducing their significance (as is happening).\n\nThere are statistics which show that educational attainment correlates with likelihood of being a non-believer. There will always be anomalies.\n\nNow if you'd like, we can discuss the logic and evidence behind our beliefs rather than just appealing to random figures of authority and anecdotal evidence.

You must have an understanding of how socialism is implemented, especially in this case, so you can point to what parts of socialism caused this crisis.\n\nI can point to the corrupt and wealthy people skimming off the oil money and taking from the country without giving back, but I can't point to how the workers owning the fruits of their production caused this crisis.",

But the 'geniuses' which may arise in these areas will never satisfy these essay writers because they didn't shift a paradigm, instead they might extend life span by 10 or 20 years or make us slightly closer to a better AI. I think that the labelling of someone as a \"genius\" is somehow a little off, as what does that mean? If we mean an IQ genius fine, that's testable and whatever, it means what it means, but if we are measuring it by other means? Does it mean a successful person? Or do they have to be a specific type of personality or what.\n\nI think the essay is probably focused on the wrong things, and certainly doesn't seem to be written with much focus on demonstrating the facts behind their wild claims, nor does it do much to develop any testable hypotheses, just plenty of objectionable theories. However, it's made for an interesting comment thread, so was worth a post.",

The increased complexity of life and the division of labour means that the geniuses aren't working on such broad paradigm-shifting ideas such as calculus and relativity, but instead very specific and complex problems in some fields, and this means they will never get the same recognition as those lucky few (with the education and freedom to pursue their genius) who built the earlier foundations.

The majority of the country does not feel that way, as only 35% of young people turned out, and 27% of the total population didn't turn out either. So only 52% of 73% votes leave, which is 38%, and not all of them are racist either.\n\nYes parts of the country have a problem, the parts who don't have any minorities in them and who are still obsessed by tribalism.\n\nBut I would be hesitant to say that the British have been too polite to \"let it out\" because that means the whole country has been that way. Most of the racist ones weren't so worried about being polite and were racist before this referendum anyway.",

I would suggest that we have more people on a par with the geniuses of old than ever before, but just that it isn't something that makes people realllly stand out as it did in the past. \n\nWith the division of labour, our geniuses affect their own field greatly, but because their own field has advanced to such a point that it is complex enough to fill most of one genius' time, we no longer have the philosopher-mathematicians, or the inventors who spread their time across disciplines, because more progress comes from them all specialising into different things and pushing the boundaries as far as they can in a smaller field.\n\nThat means you don't get the household names, because they are instead involved with how to solve the battery problem, or studying quantum physics or the origin of life or higher level mathematics, or writing philosophy etc.\n\nThere is far more competition to be a genius now than ever before, whether it is a creative one or an analytical one. Very few can stand out from the rest, and so this glut of geniuses has the appearance of a famine.",

I am able to accept that (although I think the margin was perhaps too close, and the way the demographics were split too disparate to consider it the absolute \"will of the people\" which you seem to think it is.\n\nWhy not stop alienating those who voted differently, and accept the fact that they will of course still have their concerns, and not want an unelected prime minister, who believed the EU gave us more freedom rather than less.

            "comment": "Now that would be true if firms didn't base themselves in the UK based on its access to the single market, and it would be true if our massive success in financial markets wasn't in a large part based on the fact that we have access to the free movement of capital across Europe (making here a great place to do all of your Europe investing from). And then also we would be exacerbating our people shortages in the care sector and hospital sector, and perhaps the education sector as well, where we just seem unable to get enough people qualified for the job (arguably that could be blamed on a lack of domestic investment in education, but if we don't do that then we need to take people from other countries). It isn't just about trade.\n\nWe have come to rely heavily on foreign investment across a lot of sectors. Because of this, we need to continue making ourselves attractive to these investors, or you are likely to have the situation where Frankfurt and Paris try to tempt away our financial services, and then all of the countries in Europe would be trying to incentivise the exporting firms in the UK to move to them. It isn't just about trade.\n\nAlso there are very real spiral effects in economies (see Venezuela and Argentina for some admittedly over exaggerated examples), and so a short term shock and depression disincentivises investment, means lower tax revenues, therefore less government spending etc etc etc.\n\nNow I am not seer gazing into a crystal ball, but there are a lot of things that would have to work out pretty perfectly if we left. Pitfalls everywhere, and certainly a less attractive country to invest into. \n\nAlso most of the leaving decisions we make when rehashing our laws over the two year grace period would not be made in parliament because there isn't time for that many votes. Unelected officials would be making sweeping decisions on vast areas of laws (which I know is a fetish of yours) ;)\n\nOn the topic of unelected officials, the commission is made up of one person from each member state, selected by the current elected leader of that country (Cameron appointed ours), and they have a duty to support and provide the views and opinions of their party/that head of state. So yes they aren't elected, but they are part of the democratic process, and their presence their is based on democracy. Just so you know what leave means when they say \"unelected Eurocrats are running everything\" when really it's the council of country leaders that decides on the direction of the EU.\n\nAnyway, look forward to hearing your economic analysis of the issues I have raised.",

Read this article to get a factual analysis of how it is possible to make claims like that, while it is also possible to make claims that only 13% are. Both the 65% and the 13% are misleading, but I would say it's worth understanding that Many \"eu regulations\" are similar to the kind of decisions British civil servants might make on small issues, like what do yellow lines mean on a road and how far should they be from the kerb.. Etc.\n\nGrimey, I think you'll find that a vast proportion of those who want to leave are voting on emotion and propaganda. Can you name an economist with genuine international credibility who vouches for Brexit? That \"economist\" whose video you shared who \"predicted the 2006 crash\", is about as much of an expert as the football fan who bet on Leicester. One prediction does not make an expert!

Change worked then because to change was better than not to change. It wouldn't work now because to change is worse than not to change.\n\nIf Europe becomes a genuine drag, we can leave. As it stands, leaving won't get us sovereignty back (sovereignty and fully accountable government is now impossible in the global economy, as outside economic forces have irresistible effects often - see us housing market leading to one of the worst global recessions in history), and leaving also won't get us control over immigration, unless we lose our only access to a free market of any sort.\n\nScaremongering would be scaring people based on unfounded claims, or scaring them more than the risks merit. Prudent advice for the future instead warns people of the serious risks, that could cause fairly wide spread harm to our interconnected economy. We all do worse when it shrinks, and as far as I can tell, a lot of companies are worried about our access to the single market going (which includes free movement of good, labour and capital..)",

Very hard to find, boring to talk about, and if in doubt you can always blame it on whoever was in before you. That was a more general point, rather than specifically here. But Boris is not trustworthy, and I don't know if he cares what is best for the country. Or if he does he doesn't mind swapping to something else for his own aims.",

Don't take me completely literally, but his housing policy has been immensely weighted to vanity projects rather than affordable homes. Look up the percentage of homes built that were affordable, or any non partisan review of his mayoralty.)\n\nBoris is a personality. That is his strength, to out-mojo his competitors.

Okay so we have established that the commission is by elected, but it is however partly democratic (the people who fill it are chosen as a indirect of our general elections, much like cabinet ministers). BOTH the European Parliament AND the commission have to agree about legislation. They both effectively have Vetoes (don't know if I have spelt that right). I think it massively reduces whatever this loosely defined (debatably existent) \"democratic deficit\" that you talk about. If deciding on everything that affects our countries fortunes is what you believe we should have, know that it is impossible in an economy that is interdependent with others. Regardless if we are in or out or shake it all about, our government will never be fully accountable to us because of Global Market Forces. These GMFs are determined by the governments of all countries worldwide. And their trade deals. And the multi national corporations that decide to invest or not to invest in a country, and the movement of wealth and investment decisions etc etc etc. Our being in the EU gives us more control over Global Market Forces, and thus the impact our government has on it should form a part of its accountability to the populace. We don't dictate the world economy, and we should accept that we don't dictate trading laws. They are reached by consensus. And if you want a lot of countries to agree, you need to get them all in a room regularly where they can talk about what they want and vote on it. So that they all get a say.",

The leaders of all major parties bar UKIP (debatably not a major party) think we should stay. There is no \"equally\" about it. I'm tired of hearing about this unelected commission. The U.K. Member of the commission was appointed by DAVID CAMERON. That's right, our elected prime minister chose our commission representative. They espouse the same policy position as our elected government, and are accountable, if not individually, then their party is. Enough of the deceptive claims of unelected officials, or else we should be electing every other position in government.

How many religion-inspired choral/orchestral masterpieces have been written in the last 50 years? How many great paintings and sculptures have been from people wishing to connect with their God(s). Now that the world has more freedom, instead we have films that move us to tears, and songs that are about the human condition, which can affect us in so many different ways. We have irreverent comedians bringing hours of laughter right into our homes, and we have more books being published than ever before. Where is religion in all this? I don't see religion having any positive effects, apart from arguably incentivising people to do good, but I would contest even that, because atheists have lower crime rates than religious people (from murder the theft), higher levels of tolerance across the spectrum, and are more likely to be able to think critically and make objective decisions. Now we have CCTV, forensic science, and a justice system that is on it's way to providing fair and impartial judgement, the question I have to ask is: What is religion for?",

But artists have worked for kings, and patrons, and often just for joy. Religion cannot take credit for these things, because art has always been more a status symbol to flaunt among men of power more than it has been for the pleasure of some divine ethereal being (sculpting heroes in Greece and Rome, ornate decorative armours/villas etc etc)",

They were religious, but as you said, correlation does not imply causation. The Arabic numerals are no more a product of Islam than the English language (or the World Wide Web or indeed any discovery) is the product of Protestantism. Religion did keep order, as a method of population control, where the all powerful and all seeing Deity of whatever sort would punish you for your crimes (an ever present secret police force). Many Greek philosophers didn't believe in their Gods, and their religion rarely if ever had an affect on their thirst for learning and ingenuity. Same for the Romans, Egyptians etc. They had religions, and scientific progress. But correlation does not imply causation. It is human curiosity that we can point to in each case, amplified by free time not having to feed clothe and house oneself, which drives science and progress.",

The number of times I've heard \"strain on our services\" is unbelievable. Not all are xenophobic or racist, most that I know aren't. An uncontrolled policy on immigration is by and large what we need to support our ageing population that will need a higher and higher net outflow of money from the government pot, which with our current working population (extrapolated into the future assuming less immigration) would really hurt our fiscal health as a country.\n\nI admit the faults of the EU freely. But it is worth noting, none of them are as bad as Remain makes out. The EU commission is made up of unelected officials, yes. But these officials are chosen by the governments of their respective countries (who are elected). They are there to put forward the agenda of their political party, and may as well be our Prime minister as far as any of us are concerned.\n\nNot entirely sure what you mean about EU trade deals, and yes the EU isn't healthy at the moment, but it is recovering. It's rampant neoliberalism that's to blame for that (and all of the crises).\n\nWe don't have to pay an extra 2 billion, and France and Germany aren't getting massive reductions. We pay a reasonable amount given the size of our economy and the benefits we receive.\n\nMy understanding of fishing law isn't up there. Seems U lurk that we have to give people fish though. Not sure.\n\nJobs will be lost. In ten or twenty years we'll have major shortages of doctors, teachers, carers and manual labourers. Our budget will be harder to balance than ever without plenty of working age people working hard and contributing tax. I'm proud to be British, and I'm proud to share those values with anyone who cares to come and respect them and live by them.\n\nI'm not going to tell anyone how to vote, because it's an intensely complicated and difficult decision, but personally, I see a better future for us and the world inside the EU.",

If so, then please become a politician, because we need more that do that. But plebiscite votes are predominantly not made up of people who do that.

Find out more about it rather than putting down Cameron, cause he IS a twat who can't debate on facts, only schoolboy taunts, and Boris is an egomaniac who just has decided that brexit's his best chance of PM, and farage lets be honest has no clue.

But he does say that political correctness was a good idea, to not be cruel to communities that are underrepresented or in general less able to fight their corner (whether that is down to societal lack of influence or them being systematically poorly educated or any other reason). His point is that someone \"being offended\" is not in itself a valid way to criticise somebody else's behaviour. As in offending someone is not a crime and shouldn't be a reason to curtail people's views. He doesn't say that absolute free speech is right either, and I doubt he believes that people should be free to discriminate, but he does think that offending and discriminating are different and should be treated as such.

Looool. The other things in the Bible that will stare you in the face perpetually are that the earth is flat and has four corners, that the earth is the centre of the universe, that stars can fall from the sky (and basically that stars aren't just large balls of hydrogen gas burning really far away). I'm thinking that this bible isn't always right, huh? Do you eat shellfish?",

If Christ has made some of the vicious and spiteful commandments in the Old Testament null and void, hasn't he made all of them? And if he has decided to pick some which are still valid, who gets to decide which ones he picks? It isn't like he tells us which ones are still to be followed.",

It's the furthest we have gotten so far. But it gives credence to the theory that a lightning strike or some high pressure or certain chemical reactions could have spontaneously generated life in a primordial soup of sorts, or it at least begins to point at the mystery. The other main point you made I believe was the \"finely tuned universe\" theory, which has been in my opinion exposed for its flaws.\n\nhttps://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2011/06/why-the-universe-wasnt-fine-tuned-for-life.html\n\nI'm going to go back to the post and see what else I can pick out.",

And if we manage to reverse global warming and live sustainably, and safeguard our planet, then we aren't a virus that needs to be eradicated, instead what we are right now is a destructive species that is learning and slowly prioritising sustainability more.

The brain is subject to the same cause and effect rules as the rest of the universe, and it is the system we use to make our decision. Different systems (the brains of different people) will make different choices in situations, based on how that system is constructed. It is constructed by both past experiences and genetic code, and nothing else. So it becomes not about excuses for actions, but understanding what makes people do those things, and understanding that a starving man will steal and if your family was tortured you will kill in vengeance. There are reasons people do what they do, and suffering breeds more suffering in human nature, so my point it not to excuse the crimes, but to say that torture is not an appropriate response.",

Billions more. There are many many millions of planets that are in the temperature and light range that allows for life to form, and we might just discover some one day (it's very hard to tell because they are far away and we can only see them how they were when the light left their planet). Many many planets in that range.\n\nThe third: there is a fallacy, where because we are here to observe it, we believe it is special. There could be countless universes which didn't create man, but the one that does we assume it must have been designed. Or there could be something that requires a universe to develop in this way, perhaps the laws are axiomatic. Perhaps if it was a different way, a different group of sentient creatures would have evolved, and would be saying the same things about their universe. (Very likely). So many assumptions, so little critical thinking.\n\nSCIENTISTS ARE NOT ALWAYS LOGICAL THINKERS. There is a reason Logic is taught to philosophers and mathematicians and not to scientists. You don't need it for science. Even in maths, the logic is not that of words and thought, it is that of maths, and being good at that does not make you a good critical thinker in the analysis of thought and existence.",

Battery hens suffer - unacceptable. Free range chickens and cows and pigs etc, don't suffer in life, and indeed have better lives than they could possibly expect in the wild (starving/hunted). Our ability to have abstract thought, contemplate purpose, and enjoy higher pleasures than just the physical are what differentiates us from animals. It is not superiority in terms of deserving to dominate, but instead it means that we can suffer in an abstract way as well, and so to avoid that we cannot be raised as animals can be.

Why are they here? What are their long term goals? I don't believe that most animals have goals past wishing to stay alive (which has been evolutionarily programmed into all things), and I don't know if any of us, let alone animals, have a \"meaning of life\". How should a pig be living it's life? If it isn't very different to having all its food brought to it and having endless leisure time, then isn't the eating of their meat a good thing for the species, as more total pig hours are lived because of it? Unhappy animals is wrong, but I don't think that the consumption of animal products is. Animals don't have the capacity for abstract thought and existential problems with why they exist, so if their existence itself is a positive experience that they wouldn't want to give up, should we not maximise the number of positive experiences we can create (and consider the sale of meat and animal products the means of funding said endeavour)?",

The hospitality sector (amongst others) will have a huge employment shortage, and your household bills will go up due to import tariffs that the EU will definitely impose. We will have to renegotiate our ties with NATO and indeed all military, medical, and scientific links with Europe, as well as it limiting our movement to going over there. We will no longer share intelligence as closely, and above all, we just don't know how anything is going to improve.

The Patriot act may have been a very dangerous piece of legislation, however much like with extremist views, dangerous pieces of legislation need to be debated. The House of Representatives had just voted for the USA Freedom Act which was effectively the opposite. I don't know enough about that situation to comment more. I agree there isn't a simple line that can be drawn, but much like value judgements we make in other walks of life (see reasonable doubt), judgements should still be made. Just because important discussions take place in secrecy, that doesn't mean that it's ok for the publicly available debates to become useless whenever someone decides filibustering is appropriate. It is aiming to make debates Int debates, to allow both sides to put their views forwards on important issues and ensure those issues get discussed. That's what it is aiming to achieve.",

It does perhaps correlate at this moment in time with those with left wing tendencies, but a look at past governments would suggest it is more about how authoritarian a governing body is rather than where it is on the political spectrum.

You didn't earn shit. \"Australian\" is a term for the group of people that currently live in Australia, there isn't a heritage there, so while it is good to be proud of your country (and by all means go right ahead) don't you dare take ownership and credit for the actions of those that have gone before you, and don't think that other people's successes make you any better than anyone else.",

Guns make it easier to kill, and it requires so much more determination to kill with another weapon as you have to confront the grisly reality of what you are doing, rather than the clean pulling of a trigger.

People pay more in order to be entertained more, and due to testosterone levels amongst other things, men are faster and stronger than women. Faster ball movement, more powerful sprints, and a better quality of match. They are paid according to their ability and the number of people who want to watch them. Conference players get paid less than 50k often, and from watching matches I would suggest they would be at least on par with the women's national side.",

Also if the boy was telepathic he would have gotten all 5 right. Telepathy is not being particularly good at guessing, it is being able to genuinely read someone's mind. Also the languages (at least the ones demonstrated) look like the absolute basics, and the mother could have taught him those without him having superpowers. There is a reason why that \"Doctor\" no longer works at Harvard, it's because she seems to be stupid and gullible. If you aren't convinced look up some of her other work.

I took the scissor lift off the wood and was part-way attaching it to the perspex when the caretaker people came around and I had to leave half-way through, so that still needs doing now. Perspex pulley system is also on its way to being done.",
